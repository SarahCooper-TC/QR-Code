### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned that in order to provide accessibility features, semantics must be used in the HTML. Completing the CSS prior to the layout is much more difficult and time consuming.

### Continued development

I need to explore em, rem, vh etc. more and apply them accordingly. It is much easier and faster to figure out the display layout before applying any CSS.
